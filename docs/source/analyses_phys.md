Physiological regressors can be incorporated into a generalized linear model framework to explain portions of your fMRI signal attributed to physiological effects.
* Common cardiac pulsation regressors such as heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV)
* Respiratory
* Blood Gasses
* Lymphatics
