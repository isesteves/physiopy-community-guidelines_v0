# 2. What type of physiological data does the Physiopy community work with?

The most common types of physiological data acquired in fMRI analysis within members of our community are cardiac (photoplethysmographypulse, ECG/EKG) and respiration, either ventilation (respiratory belt) and/or gas concentration (particularly expired CO2). Links to some common examples and tools provided by members of the community and their labs' websites are listed below if you wish to reach out about questions or look through any methods/analyses in their publications.
